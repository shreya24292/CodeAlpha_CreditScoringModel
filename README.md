#  Credit Scoring Model – CodeAlpha Internship (Task 1)

##  Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is likely to **default on a credit** based on their financial profile.

This task is part of the **Machine Learning Internship at CodeAlpha**.
